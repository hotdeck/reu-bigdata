# Computational Modeling in Transportation and Urban Planning

.pull-left[
### Computational modeling is useful in Transportation and Urban Planning because:
- Substantial public investment and polices that affects lives of thousands or millions;
- Public investment and polices are hard to reverse or irreversible
- The urban system is complex

# Visioning vs Modeling

.pull-left[
- **Visioning** is a community oriented planning technique used to identify regional land-use and transportation goals
- **Objectives**: Consensus-building of the region's future
- **Tools**: Sketch planning tools (Envision Tomorrow+, CommunityViz, ...), paper/tablet maps, lego bricks
- Primarily driving by user-controlled inputs
- Limited by the quality of the public involvement and consensus-building, the feasibility of the preferred scenario

# Visioning vs Modeling

.pull-left[
- **Urban Models** predict a region’s future traffic, spatial distribution of households and employment 
- **Objectives**: anticipating direct and indirect impacts of policies/planns/public investment
- **Tools**: Travel demand models, UrbanSim, DRAM/EPAL, MetroScope, CubeLand, ...
- Primarily driving by base year conditions, scenario inputs, and model assumptions
- Limited by the quality of inputs and model assumptions

Evolution of Urban Models

---

# UrbanSim (1)

![UrbanSim](resources/UrbanSim.png)
---

# UrbanSim (2)

- A model system for analyzing urban development
- Development started in late 1990s
- First developed in Java, later re-implemented with Python as an open source project (https://github.com/UDST/urbansim)
- Applications in dozens of regions in the US and many more around the globe

---

# Regional Strategic Planning Model (2)

- A light-weighted modeling tool for transportation and land use policies visioning and evaluating
- Implmented in statstical programming language R
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval
- Applications in Oregon, Florida, Georgia

# Impact of Autonomous Vehicle Technology
- How adoption of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles affects traffic?
- How they affect travel behavior and travel demand?
- What are the requirement for the transportation and land use system (roadwork network, parking, etc)?
- Long term impact on land use?

# Machine Learning

.pull-left[
![Breiman2003](resources/Breiman2001_data-modeling.png)

**Statistical models** ("the data modeling"): Assuming a data generation model and use data and hypothesis testing framework to recover parameters of the data generation process; the focus is more on `\(\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}\)`.
]

.pull-right[
![Breiman2003](resources/Breiman2001_algo-modeling.png)

**Machine learning** ("algorithmic modeling"): With no assumption of data generation process, use computer algorithms for pattern recognition and data-driven predictions-making; the focus is `\(\boldsymbol{\hat{Y}}\)`
